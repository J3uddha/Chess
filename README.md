# Chess
This is my chess game built in Ruby.

### How to run

After downloading and opening this repo, run

```
gem install colorize
ruby chess.rb
```

The `colorize` gem is required and supplies the board with green and
white tiles for gameplay. In addition, the `cursorable` library allows
for movement with the arrow keys across the board.

### How to play

This game is for 2 players.
* Move your cursor with the arrow keys/WSAD/HJKL to the
* piece you would like to move.
* Select it with `spacebar` or `enter`
* Move the cursor to a position and hit `spacebar` or `enter` again
